## Promptober Bot

1. This bot is in its own channel, this mini game needs two players. 
2. When two players are in the "lobby", the bot will provide a word.
3. It then starts a timer, maybe 3min or 5min? 
4. Within that time period, the two users must submit a dall-e generated image associated with that word.
5. Upon submission, the bot will combine player 1 & 2's generation and posts it in another channel where the public can vote.
6. Voting could be for 24 hours each posts.
7. The one with the most votes win.

We should restrict users so that they can only submit once per 24 hrs. W
